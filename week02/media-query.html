            <h2>1 Nephi 2:16</h2>
            <p>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being exceedingly young, nevertheless being large in stature, and also
                having great desires to know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he
                did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my
                father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my brothers.</p>

            <h2>Doctrine and Covenants 58:27-28</h2>
            <p>Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will,
                and bring to pass much righteousness;
                For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they
                shall in nowise lose their reward.</p>
